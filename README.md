AquilaBev Digital Analytics (SCM) platform is a modern data engineering and business intelligence project designed to simulate a FMCG enterprise-grade supply chain analytics platform. The project focuses on building a scalable data warehouse, automated data pipelines, and interactive BI reporting to support data-driven decision making.

The solution follows industry best practices including structured data ingestion, transformation pipelines, orchestration workflows, and business intelligence reporting. It leverages cloud data engineering concepts, version control integration, and CI/CD principles to reflect real-world analytics platform architecture.

# Key Components
1. Data Warehouse (DWH): Data ingestion, transformation, orchestration workflows, and utility scripts.

2. BI Reporting: Power BI reports, DAX logic, and reusable dashboard templates.

3. Documentation: Architecture design, ETL specifications, BI design documents, and source-to-target mappings (STTM).

4. DevOps Integration: Git-based version control, Databricks development workflow, and CI/CD readiness.

# Objective
The primary goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end analytics ecosystem that mirrors enterprise supply chain analytics environments while showcasing data engineering, analytics engineering, and BI development capabilities.
